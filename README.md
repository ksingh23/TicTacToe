# TicTacToe

1. Disregard the Applet.java file- the real driver class is TicTacToeMain.java. I am unsure how to delete files on here.

Board.java: used to initialize panels, buttons, grid, and other GUI elements

CheckWinner.java: used to check if one of X or O has won yet

DrawX.java: used to draw the "X" string for the icon on the board

DrawO.java: used to draw the "O" string for the icon on the board

TicTacToeMain.java: driver class
